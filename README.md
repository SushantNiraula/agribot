## MY_BOTS src.
This is a repo where i will be sharing the build of my agribot and the bumperbot at the same time. I am learning with 2 wheel differential drive bumperbot with 2 caster wheels as a concept and applying it to my 6 wheel differential drive agribot. This is the way i am sharing my learnings into this repo. It's completely for the ground based UAV. 


agribot_description is where we defined the agribot urdf, meshes and launch files.
bumperbot_description is where we defined the bumperbot urdf, meshes and launch files. 
bumperbot_examples_cpp and bumperbot_examples_py are the packages where i implement my learnings before putting it in the bumperbot actual ones and agribot.
